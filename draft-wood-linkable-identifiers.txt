1.  Introduction

   Privacy is an increasingly important topic in networks and protocols.
   [RFC6973] defines correlation of information relevant to or
   associated with a specific user as a significant attack on privacy.
   Such information can be exposed at any network stack layer.  For
   example, a MAC address, if not properly rotated or randomized, may be
   used to link network packets to a single device.  Many standards
   suggest randomizing or otherwise rotating such identifiers on a
   regular basis.  Often, such advice is followed by recommendations to
   change other identifiers, e.g., IP addresses, host names, etc., in
   unison.  For example, Huitema et al.  [I-D.ietf-dnssd-privacy] say,
   "it is important that the obfuscation of instance names is performed
   at the right time, and that the obfuscated names change in synchrony
   with other identifiers, such as MAC Addresses, IP Addresses or host
   names."  Consider the following example where this advice is not
   followed, wherein an IP address is changed yet the MAC address is
   not.

   +---------------+        +---------------+
   |      ...      |  ....  |      ...      |
   +---------------+        +---------------+
   | IP Address  A <---//---> IP Address  B |
   +---------------+        +---------------+
   | MAC Address A <--------> MAC Address A |
   +---------------+        +---------------+

Internet-Draft            linkable-identifiers             February 2018


   An adversary may trivially link these packets together.  In this
   document, we outline simple rules that SHOULD be followed by protocol
   implementations to avoid such trivial linkability.  We then survey
   protocols developed inside the IETF and out, and identify their
   sticky identifiers.  Results were obtained by analyzing protocol
   documentation and specifications, and also scanning packet traces
   captured from protocols in practice on common systems.

2.  Identifier Scope and Threat Model

   Not all packet or datagram identifiers are visible end-to-end.  For
   example, MAC addresses are only visible on local subnets.  IP
   addresses are only visible between endpoints.  (In systems such as
   Tor, source and destination addresses change at each circuit hop.)
   Thus, threats to identifier linkability depend on the threat model
   under consideration.  Off-path adversaries are generally not a
   problem since they do not have access to datagrams in flight.  On-
   path adversaries may exist at various locations relative to an
   endpoint (sender or receiver) on a path, e.g., in a local subnet, as
   an intermediate router or middlebox between two endpoints, or as a
   TLS terminating reverse proxy.  In this document, we categorize these
   three types of adversaries as follows:

   1.  Local: An on-path adversary belonging to the same local subnet as
       an endpoint, a switch.

   2.  Intermediate: An on-path adversary that observes datagrams in
       flight but does not terminate a (TCP or TLS) connection, e.g., a
       middlebox or performance enhancing proxy (PEP).

   3.  Terminator: An on-path adversary that terminates a connection,
       e.g., a TLS-terminating reverse proxy.

3.  Sticky Protocol Identifiers

   In this section, we survey existing protocols developed inside and
   out of the IETF, and identify sticky protocol identifiers for each.
   A stick identifier is one that does not change across protocol
   "sessions," regardless of whether it is transmitted in the clear or
   not.  This may include state-generating servers or, commonly, client
   algorithm, software configuration, or device-specific fields.  We
   categorize surveyed protocols by OSI layer at which they operate.
   Specifically, we focus on Link, Internet, Transport, Session, and
   Application layers.  (Our taxonomy may not match traditional OSI
   models, though we consider it sufficiently representative.)

3.1.  Link Layer

   XXX: address

   Ethernet: MAC address XXX: include other link layer types from DHCP
   spec?

3.2.  Internet Layer

   o  IPv4 and IPv6: address

3.3.  Transport Layer

   o  TCP [RFC0793]: TCP source ports may be sticky if reused across
      senders.  For example, most operating systems allocate allocate
      ephemeral (short lived) ports to each new connection.  Per IANA
      allocations, ephemeral ports range from 49152 to 65535 (2^15+2^14
      to 2^16-1) [http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers].
      However, this does not prevent an application from re-using port
      across connections.  Destination are also intentionally sticky,
      since they identify services offered by endpoints.  Therefore,
      reusing a destination port does not lead to decreased linkability.

   o  MPTCP [RFC6824]: Connection tokens or IDs are explicitly used to
      link MPTCP subflows between IP address pairs.  These tokens are
      only exposed during flow management operations, e.g., when
      creating new subflows.  Normal data transfer uses TCP sequence
      numbers to bypass middlebox interference and an additional data
      sequence number (DSN) TCP option to allow receivers to deal with
      out-of-order subflow packet arrival.  The union of packet DSNs
      across subflows should yield a contiguous packet number sequence.

   o  SCTP: multihome (IP sending addresses in INIT chunks, this is not
      a mandatory parameter as per RFC4960), Initiate tag (used across
      multiple addresses), Address Families

   o  RTP: application performance reporting

3.4.  Session Layer

   o  TLS: session IDs, and possibly algorithms (though the space of
      possible values is large here), DTLS 1.3 connection IDs

   o  QUIC: connection ID

3.5.  Application Layer:

   o  HTTP ((CITE)): Cookies are sticky identifiers created chosen by
      servers to carry application state across requests.  Cookies might
      contain information about client identity or authentication
      preferences

   o  DNS: SRV hostnames

   o  DHCP: broadcast discover requests, hardware type, client hardware
      address, IP addresses (http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/protocol/
      dhcp.htm), transaction identifier

   o  NTP: (mode 3 -- client to server, https://tools.ietf.org/html/
      draft-ietf-ntp-data-minimization-01#section-3): Timestamps, poll
      field, precision field, all other fields (Stratum, Root Delay,
      Root Dispersion, Ref ID, Ref Timestamp, Origin Timestamp, Receive
      Timestamp)

   o  IMAP: username/password login...

   Others: IMAP, LDAP, IKE/ESP, SRTP, oath, SIP, SSH, SNMP, ICMP, ARP

4.  Limiting Linkable Identifiers

   The introductory example illustrating packet linkability using MAC
   addresses is one of many possible ways in which an attacker may link
   packets.  As another hypothetical example, assume that IP address and
   MAC addresses were properly rotated.  Moreover, assume TLS session
   IDs were reused over time, as shown below.

   +---------------+        +---------------+
   |TLS SessionID X<-------->TLS SessionID X|
   +---------------+        +---------------+
   |      ...      |  ....  |      ...      |
   +---------------+        +---------------+
   | IP Address  A <---//---> IP Address  B |
   +---------------+        +---------------+
   | MAC Address A <---//---> MAC Address C |
   +---------------+        +---------------+

   +------------------------------------------>
                     time

   Despite rotating all protocol identifiers beneath TLS, a static
   session identifier makes packet linkability trivial.  Thus, a strict,
   yet safe rule for removing packet linkability is to rotate all
   identifiers in unison.  Unfortunately, this strategy is problematic

   in practice.  It would imply terminating active connections whenever
   an identifier changes (otherwise, linkability remains trivial).  If
   MAC addresses are rotated on a regular basis, e.g., every 15 minutes,
   then connection lifetimes are bounded by this window.

   Moreover, there are multiple dimensions along which identifiers may
   be linked: in time, as identifiers are used and re-used by senders,
   and space, as identifiers are duplicated across multiple disjoint
   network paths.  We refer to these dimensions as time and path
   linkability, respectively.

   Time linkability is arguably simpler to mitigate, since new
   connections over time may opt to use new identifiers.  For example,
   instead of resuming a TLS session with an existing session ID, a
   client may initiate a fresh handshake.  In contrast, path linkability
   is more difficult to achieve, as it requires

   XXX: describe why -- involves cutting off connections, possibly.
   Need to align rotation events to minimize or limit linkability
   leakage: if identifier at layer (N) changes, then identifiers at
   layer (N - 1) and below should also change.  (If TLS session ID
   changes for resumption, then all IP address, TCP port, Ethernet MAC
   address, etc. should also rotate)

   XXX: discuss difference in linkability across time and space
   (multiple paths). time is easier to enforce. space is harder to
   accomplish.

5.  Timing Considerations

   Advice in this document SHOULD NOT be interpreted as guarantees for
   preventing linkability.  Rather, they aim to increase linkability
   complexity.  It is difficult to prevent path-linkability without
   modifying protocols above the layer at which identifiers rotate.  For
   example, assuming MPTCP subflows were unlinkable across paths, shared
   transport state controlling the rate of data transmission may be
   sufficient to link these flows.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no request to IANA.
