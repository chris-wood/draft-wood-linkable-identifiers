--- abstract

Rotating public identifiers is encouraged as best practice as a means of
protecting endpoint privacy. For example, regular MAC address randomization
helps mitigate device tracking across time and space.
Other protocols beyond those in the link layer also have public identifiers
or parameters that should rotate over time, in unison with coupled protocol
identifiers, and perhaps with application level identifiers. This document
surveys such privacy-related identifiers exposed by common Internet protocols
at various layers in a network stack. It provides advice for rotating linked
identifiers such that privacy violations do not occur from rotating one
identifier while neglecting to rotate coupled identifiers.

# Introduction

{{RFC6973}} defines the correlation of information relevant to or
associated with a specific user as a significant attack on privacy.
Different layers of the network stack use identifiers to uniquely
address hosts or information flows.
To mitigate the privacy concern, many standards suggest randomizing
or otherwise rotating such identifiers on a regular basis.
For example, a MAC address may be used to link otherwise unrelated
network packets to a single device. Rotating the MAC address prevents
this association at the link layer.
However, when multiple identifiers are simultaneously present on
different layers of the stack, breaking the association at any
individual layer might be insufficient to disassociate a host
from their network traffic. Linkability can also occur across protocols and/or
across layers.
For example, TLS connections are commonly preceded by DNS queries for a
particular endpoint (host name), e.g. example.com. Moreover, in the TLS
handshake, this same host name is sent in cleartext in the Server Name
Indication extension. Thus, observing either the DNS query or TLS SNI reveals
information about the other. Similarly, while an IP address of a device may
rotate, if web browser cookies do not, then, a website can track the various
IP addresses of a given cookie over time.

Huitema et al. {{I-D.ietf-dnssd-privacy}} say, "it is important
that the obfuscation of instance names is performed at the right time, and
that the obfuscated names change in synchrony with other identifiers, such as
MAC Addresses, IP Addresses or host names."
Consider the following example where this advice is not followed,
wherein an IP address is changed yet the MAC address is not.

~~~
+---------------+        +---------------+
|      ...      |  ....  |      ...      |
+---------------+        +---------------+
| IP Address  A <---//---> IP Address  B |
+---------------+        +---------------+
| MAC Address A <--------> MAC Address A |
+---------------+        +---------------+

+---------------------------------------->
                  time
~~~

A network adversary may trivially link these packets based on their common
MAC address and continue to associate traffic with this particular host based
on IP address B even if the MAC address eventually changes in the future.
In this document, we outline simple rules that SHOULD be followed by protocol
implementations to avoid such linkability.
We then survey protocols developed inside the IETF and out, and identify their
sticky identifiers. Results were obtained by analyzing protocol documentation
and specifications, and also scanning packet traces captured from protocols in
practice on common systems.

# Sticky Protocol Identifiers

In this section, we survey existing protocols developed inside and out of the
IETF, and identify sticky protocol identifiers for each. A sticky identifier
is one that persists across logically grouped data exchanges between a client
and server.
This may include state-generating servers or, commonly, client algorithm,
software configuration, or device-specific fields.
We categorize surveyed protocols by the OSI layer at which they operate.
Specifically, we focus on Link, Internet, Transport, Session, and Application
layers.
(Our taxonomy may not match traditional OSI models, though we consider it
sufficiently representative.)

## Internet and Link Layer

- Ethernet, 802.11, and Bluetooth: MAC addresses are fixed to specific devices.
Unless frequently rotated, they are sticky identifiers. Simply rotating the MAC
address may or may not be sufficient depending on other information sent at the
protocol layer with the a (rotated) MAC address. For example, in 802.11,
frames have an incrementing sequence number and if the sequence number is not
reset in unison with a MAC address change, the sequence number can be used to
re-correlate randomized MAC addresses.

- IPv4 and IPv6: Static or infrequently rotating addresses are sticky
identifiers when exposed on the network. Privacy Extensions for Stateless
Address Autoconfiguration {{RFC4941}} enhance IPv6 client privacy by, e.g.,
issuing new IPv6 /64 prefixes every day. The 64-bit IID suffix remains random
to deter linkability.

- IKEv2: Initiator Security Parameters Indexes (SPIs) are used as connection
identifiers instead of IP addresses. They are required to rotate for each new
SA.

## Transport and Session Layer

- TCP {{RFC0793}}: TCP source ports may be sticky if reused across senders.
For example, most operating systems allocate allocate ephemeral (short lived)
ports to each new connection. Per IANA allocations, ephemeral ports range from
49152 to 65535 (2^15+2^14 to 2^16âˆ’1)
[http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers]. However, this does not prevent
an application from re-using port across connections. Destination are also
intentionally sticky, since they identify services offered by endpoints.
Therefore, reusing a destination port does not lead to decreased linkability.
Moreover, with TCP Fast Open (TFO) {{RFC7413}}, servers give clients plaintext
cookies that must be re-used when resuming a TCP+TFO connection. Clients do not
modify these server cookies, which therefore means they can be tracked.

- MPTCP {{RFC6824}}: Connection tokens or IDs are explicitly used to link MPTCP
subflows between IP address pairs. These tokens are only exposed during flow
management operations, e.g., when creating new subflows. Normal data transfer
uses TCP sequence numbers to bypass middlebox interference and an additional
data sequence number (DSN) TCP option to allow receivers to deal with
out-of-order subflow packet arrival. The union of packet DSNs across subflows
should yield a contiguous packet number sequence.

- TLS {{RFC5246}} {{RFC8446}}: Prior to TLS 1.3, significant information is exposed during
TLS handshakes, including: session identifiers (or re-used PSK identifiers in
TLS 1.3), timestamps, random nonces, supported ciphersuites, certificates, and
extensions. Many of these are common across all TLS clients -- specifically,
ciphersuites, nonces, and timestamps. However, others may persist across active
sessions, including: session identifiers (in TLS 1.2 and earlier versions) and
re-used PSK identifiers (in TLS 1.3). Without rotation, these re-used
identifers are sticky.

- DTLS {{RFC6347}}: Datagram TLS is a slightly modified variant of TLS aimed to
run over datagram protocols such as UDP. In addition to identifiers exposed via
TLS, DTLS adds cookie-based denial-of-service countermeasures. Servers issue
stateless cookies to clients during a handshake, which must be replayed in
cleartext by clients to prove ownership of its IP address. (This is similar to
TFO cookies described above.) Additionally, DTLS is considering support of a
static connection identifier (CID) {{I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id}}, which
permits client address mobility. CIDs are specifically designed to not change
across addresses.

- QUIC {{I-D.ietf-quic-transport}}: QUIC is another secure transport protocol
originally developed by Google and now being standardized by the IETF.
IETF-QUIC {{I-D.ietf-quic-transport}} uses TLS 1.3 for its handshake. In
addition to identifiers exposed by TLS 1.3, QUIC has its own connection
identifier (CID) used to permit address mobility.

<!-- RTP: application performance reporting -->
<!-- SRTP: ??? -->

## Application Layer:

- HTTP {{RFC2616}}: While HTTP is a stateless protocol, it enables applications
to define state-keeping mechanisms in header fields. The fields might carry
the state itself or tokens pointing to state kept at the endpoints.
The Cookie header field {{RFC6265}} is de-facto the mechanism for web
applications to uniquely identify their clients by generating a token
and instructing the client to attach to any future requests.
The ETag header field {{RFC7232}} enables applications to uniquely reference
a resource which the client may cache. Applications may return unique
reference tokens to distinct clients.

- DNS {{RFC1035}}: SRV records often contain human-readable information
specific to particular devices, clients, or users. For example, printers may
advertise its services with SRV records that contain a human-readable instance
name. These are often not rotated as services change.

- NTP {{RFC5905}}: By default, mode 3 for NTP -- client to server -- sends
several source-specific fields in the clear to NTP servers, including:
timestamps, poll, and precision. These fields should be left empty or
randomized as per {{I-D.ietf-ntp-data-minimization}}. Other fields that may
link to clients include: Stratum, Root Delay, Root Dispersion, Ref ID, Ref
Timestamp, Origin Timestamp, and Receive Timestamp.

# Identifier Scope and Threat Model

Not all packet identifiers are visible end-to-end in a client-server
interaction. For example, MAC addresses are only visible to those with physical
access to the medium -- the local subnet for Ethernet and proximity for Wi-Fi;
we will consider both of these "on-path" for the sake of this analysis.
IP addresses are only visible between endpoints. (In systems such as Tor,
source and destination addresses change at each circuit hop.) Thus, identifier
linkability depends on the threat model under consideration. Off-path
adversaries, e.g. those without physical access to the medium, are not
considered a problem since they do not have access to packets in flight.
On-path adversaries may exist at various locations relative to an endpoint
(sender or receiver) on a path, e.g., in a local subnet, as an intermediate
router or middlebox between two endpoints, or as a TLS terminating reverse
proxy. In this document, we categorize these three types of adversaries
as follows:

1. Local: An on-path adversary belonging to the same local subnet as an
endpoint, e.g., a switch.
2. Intermediate: An on-path adversary that observes datagrams in flight but
does not terminate a (TCP or TLS) connection, e.g., a middlebox or performance
enhancing proxy (PEP).
3. Terminator: An on-path adversary that terminates a connection, e.g., a TLS-
terminating reverse proxy. Note that there can be distinct terminators for
individual layers of network stack. E.g., one for TLS and another for HTTP.

The scope of an identifier includes are all other protocols and layers
observable by the same adversary.

# Limiting Linkable Identifiers

The introductory example illustrating packet linkability using MAC addresses is
one of many possible ways in which an attacker may link packets. As another
hypothetical example, assume that IP address and MAC addresses were properly
rotated, whereas TLS session identifiers were reused over time, as shown below.

~~~
+---------------+        +---------------+
| TLS Session X <--------> TLS Session X |
+---------------+        +---------------+
|      ...      |  ....  |      ...      |
+---------------+        +---------------+
| IP Address  A <---//---> IP Address  B |
+---------------+        +---------------+
| MAC Address A <---//---> MAC Address C |
+---------------+        +---------------+

+------------------------------------------>
                  time
~~~

Despite rotating all protocol identifiers beneath TLS, a static session
identifier makes packet linkability trivial. Thus, a strict, yet safe rule for
removing packet linkability is to rotate all linked identifiers in unison.
Unfortunately, this strategy is problematic in practice. It would imply
terminating active connections whenever an identifier changes (otherwise,
linkability remains trivial). For example, if MAC addresses are rotated on a
regular basis, e.g., every 15 minutes, then connection lifetimes would be
limited to this window.

A more sensible policy would be to restrict identifier rotation to layers which
are exposed to the same adversary. For example, origin MAC addresses may not be
visible to the destination. In this case, rotating IP addresses and TLS session
identifiers is not required to prevent packet linkability by an adversary who
does not see the origin MAC address. A realistic threat model is one in which
IP- to TLS-layer information is exposed to the same on-path adversary.
Identifiers beneath IP are visible to local adversaries, which may not be an
issue, and those above TLS are visible to authenticated peers.

## Time and Path Linkability

There are multiple dimensions along which identifiers may be linked: (1) time,
as identifiers are used and re-used by senders, and (2) space, as identifiers
are duplicated across multiple disjoint network paths, possibly by different
protocols. We refer to these dimensions as time and path linkability,
respectively.

Time linkability is arguably simpler to mitigate, since new connections over
time may opt to use new identifiers. For example, instead of resuming a TLS
session with an existing session ID, a client may initiate a fresh handshake.
As a simple rule, if an identifier in the same scope changes, endpoints SHOULD
use fresh identifiers for all other protocols in that scope. This means that,
for identifiers visible to intermediate adversaries, new TLS sessions SHOULD be
initiated from an endpoint with a fresh IP address and TCP source port. Note
that clients behind NATs may not need to generate a fresh IP address, as they
enjoy some measure of anonymity by design. If local adversaries were considered
part of the threat model, then a fresh MAC address may also be needed.

In contrast, path linkability is more difficult to achieve, as it requires
using fresh identifiers for each protocol field. This may not always be
technically feasible. For example, DNS query names are also intentionally used
as the TLS SNI. Moreover, protocols such as QUIC explicitly try to enable path
linkability via connection-level identifiers (CIDs) to support multihoming or
mobile endpoints. This makes path linkability impossible to mitigate. However,
as multiple, disjoint paths may be operated by different entities (e.g., ISPs),
collusion may be less common.

# Timing Considerations

Advice in this document SHOULD NOT be interpreted as guarantees for preventing
linkability. Rather, it aims to increase linkability complexity. It is
difficult to prevent path-linkability without modifying protocols above the
layer at which identifiers rotate. For example, assuming MPTCP subflows were
unlinkable across paths, shared transport state controlling the rate of data
transmission may be sufficient to link these flows.
